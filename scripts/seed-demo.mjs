// Seeds the three demo hackathons that demo accounts look around
// (src/lib/demo.ts):
//
//   • demo-open-agents-2026: finished. Two phases judged and closed, final
//     ranking, award winners, results published at /w/demo-open-agents-2026.
//   • demo-voice-ai-buildathon: mid-judging. The agent has reviewed every
//     project (two failed a gate and wait in the agent-failed inbox), and the
//     judges are about 60% through the first phase.
//   • demo-climate-tools-jam: fresh. The default setup plus four judges, no
//     projects yet.
//
// Run it with
//
//   node --env-file-if-exists=.env.local scripts/seed-demo.mjs [--owner email]
//
// The demos belong to one account: --owner, else DEMO_OWNER_EMAIL, else
// demo-owner@roundone.dev, created without a password if it doesn't exist.
// Everything is written as that account, through the RPCs and tables the
// app's server actions use, so RLS applies and the data matches what the UI
// makes. Judges score through their own links, as they would for real. The
// agent's reviews are synthetic: no AI calls and no fetching project links.
// Nothing sends email or starts a workflow.
//
// Re-running replaces the demos: the three slugs are deleted (only when the
// demo owner owns them; it stops if another account has one) and made again.
// Last, the demos are flagged `demo`, which needs migrations/*_demo_accounts.sql.
