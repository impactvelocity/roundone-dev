## Endpoint

- Create projects: \`POST ${endpoint}\`
- Read the current schema: \`GET ${endpoint}\`
- Auth header on both: \`Authorization: Bearer ${key}\`
- Body: JSON, \`{ "projects": [ {…}, {…} ] }\`, at most ${MAX_BATCH} projects per request.

## Fields

Every field is optional, but send the first one (the project's name) and \`${CONTACT_FIELD.key}\` when you can. Unknown keys are rejected.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
${rows.join("\n")}
| \`${CONTACT_FIELD.key}\` | string | ${CONTACT_FIELD.title} — ${CONTACT_FIELD.description} |

- \`string[]\` fields take a JSON array of strings (image and file fields take public links, not uploads).
- Links without \`https://\` get it added.
- Leave a field out rather than sending an empty string.

Example project:

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(exampleProject(fields), null, 2)}
\`\`\`

## Responses

- \`201\` → \`{ "created": [{ "number": 12, "id": "…" }] }\`, in the order sent.
- \`422\` → \`{ "error": "…", "errors": [{ "index": 0, "error": "…" }] }\`. Nothing in that request was saved: fix the rows listed and resend the whole batch.
- \`429\` → rate limited (${LIMITS.api.limit} requests a minute per key). Wait for the \`Retry-After\` seconds, then retry.
- \`401\` → the key is wrong or the API was switched off.

## How to do the import

1. Open the source I point you at (spreadsheet, CSV, JSON, another tool's export) and list its columns.
2. Propose a mapping from source columns to the keys above, and show me 2–3 converted rows. Wait for my OK before sending anything.
3. Split multi-value cells (team members, image links) into arrays. Skip empty or duplicate rows.
4. Send in batches of up to ${MAX_BATCH}. Don't resend a batch that returned \`201\`: that would create duplicates.
5. Tell me how many projects were created and their numbers, and list any rows you skipped and why.
