-- Judge links: every judge gets a private page at /j/<access_token> where they
-- work through their queue for the running phase and score it themselves.
-- Also an admin's own review of a project (one more score for the phase, on
-- top of the assigned judges'), and the start screen judges see, edited from
-- Setup › Judge portal.

-- needs no secret key. Regenerating a judge's token retires their old link.
