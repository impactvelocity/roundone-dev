-- Hackathon-wide reward rules: one row per hackathon, edited from Judging ›
-- Rewards › Settings. A hackathon without a row uses the defaults.
--
-- one_win_per_entrant: a person or team with several projects wins at most
-- one reward. Projects are the same entrant when they share a member in a
-- Team field. Their best-placed project keeps its prize and the places below
-- move up (lib/prize-places.ts); awards skip entrants that already won.
