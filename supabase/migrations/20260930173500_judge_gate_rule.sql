-- Judges' gate verdicts count. A gate (a pass/fail criterion that gates
-- eligibility) used to rule a project out only when the agent failed it; a
-- judge failing it just lowered their total. Each hackathon now picks what
-- failed gates in reviews do, in Setup › Distribution:
--
--   • 'flag': nothing automatic. The project shows which gates failed and in
--     how many reviews, and an admin decides (disqualifying it by hand if they
--     agree).
--   • 'rule_out' (the default): once judge_gate_count submitted reviews fail
--     the same gate, the project is ineligible. It ranks below every project
--     that passed, is eliminated when its phase closes instead of advancing or
--     taking a final rank, and can't win an award.
--
-- Reviews are counted rather than distinct judges, from every phase, so a
-- second look in a later phase adds to the count.
