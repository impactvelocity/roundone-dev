-- The judge-images and hackathon-logos policies referenced the object path as
-- a bare `name`, which inside `exists (select … from public.hackathons h …)`
-- resolves to hackathons.name, so no upload ever matched. Qualify it as
-- objects.name and route the check through one helper.

-- True when the signed-in user owns the hackathon whose id is the first
-- folder of a storage object path (<hackathon_id>/…).
