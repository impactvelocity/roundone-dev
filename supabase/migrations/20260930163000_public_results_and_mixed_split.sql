-- The public winners page, and a fairer "mixed" split of judging work.
--
-- /w/<slug> is read by visitors without an account, but RLS keeps projects,
-- rewards and awards private to the hackathon's owner. public_results()
-- returns only what that page shows, once results are published (and to the
-- owner before that, as a preview). Judges' scores, notes and redeemable
-- reward details (codes, links) stay private.
--
-- start_judging_phase's mixed strategy shifted the pool once per project, so a
-- run of projects could land on the same few judges (loads like 8/5/4/7 where
-- 6/6/6/6 was possible). It now rotates the pool once per lap of slots: every
-- judge still gets one slot per lap, so loads differ by at most one, and each
-- lap pairs judges differently.
