-- The graphic reviewer is retired as a mechanism. Existing criteria drop it
-- (one left with nothing falls back to the agent judge, which is what the
-- agent already did with an empty list), the check stops allowing it, and new
-- hackathons' default rubric leaves it out. Old agent_review_steps rows keep
-- the name in their history; the project page skips mechanisms it doesn't know.
